# crowd-sourced-answers-ui

## Project created with react-native init

run `npm install` and use the react native cli to run ios/andriod on simulators with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

The idea is to create a crowd sourced list of questions and answers for specific work groups to answer questions to complicated HR/Job related questions. The resulting list can be up/down voted and saved locally for offline use.
